The term report will be a quantitative analysis of:

1.  How a certain tissue responds to exogenous mechanical forces; or
2.  How exogenous mechanical forces generated by cells in a tissue are involved in the physiology or pathology of the tissue; or
3.  Both _e.g_., how exogenous forces "regulate" cell contraction.

The reports will be prepared individually by each student; no collaboration is permitted on the term report. Possible topics for the term report will be discussed in class during the first weeks of class. The focus of the term report should not be on work related to a master's or doctoral thesis.

The term report will be twelve pages maximum. The report needs to be meaningfully annotated and needs to include references. The page limit includes all text, images and references.
