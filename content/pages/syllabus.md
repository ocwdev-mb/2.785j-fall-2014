Description
-----------

Mechanical forces play a decisive role during development of tissues and organs, during remodeling following injury as well as in normal function. A stress field influences cell function primarily through deformation of the extracellular matrix to which cells are attached. Deformed cells express different biosynthetic activity relative to undeformed cells. The unit cell process paradigm combined with topics in connective tissue mechanics form the basis for discussions of several topics from cell biology, physiology, and medicine.

Performance on the homework sets and class participation may also be taken into consideration, particularly for borderline grades.

Collaboration Policy
--------------------

Students are to work independently on their homework sets, quizzes, and term report (_i.e_., no collaboration).
